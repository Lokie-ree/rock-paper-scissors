# rock-paper-scissors
This project is part of the Fundamental course in web development.  The game will be played first in the console.  More features and functionality will be added at a later date

Step 1: Setup the project structure
    > Create and clone repository
    > Create files: index.html and script.js
    > Link script to html
    > Committed changes to initial files

Step 2: Write the logic to get the computer's choice
    > Create a function named getComputerChoice that will randomly return one of the following random strings: "rock, paper, or scissors"
    > Used Math.floor and Math.random to generate a random number from 1 to 3
    > Used if/else conditional logic to return Rock (1), Paper (2), and Scissors (3) from the function
    > Committed changes to script file (getComputerChoice function) and modified README
